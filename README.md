Either the initial funds in the account or the money I deposited when I got the package can be withdrawn after completed 40/40
It's like we need to pay money to buy for an item, but we don't really need to buy the item, we just need to complete the 40/40 and then we can withdraw the commission and the money in our account, the deposit is just going through the process. The money we deposit is not spent or lost
That's why we need to use money to help merchants generate real product sales data
